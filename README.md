# Marketing Analyst Task

1) Give an overview of our channels and how they contribute to user acquisition.
2) Estimate the impact of doubling TV spending
3) Make appropriate assumptions for the channel touchpoint cost. With your assumptions
 give recommendations how to change the budget allocation to maximize user acquisition with a constant budget

## Data (1000% fictitious)
`tv_campaigns.csv`
- a csv with dates on which heavy TV spend was active (assume equal spend on each day)

`user_signup_data.csv`
- a csv with the userid, signup date & binary variables indicating whether
  the user interacted with a given marketing channel prior to signup

Please visualize all your findings / reasonings in an appropriate way. Prepare a short (5-10min) presentation (PDF).
Submit all your source code (R, Python, SQL or similar) and comment it well,
so that we can understand your line of thought and approach to the problems.
